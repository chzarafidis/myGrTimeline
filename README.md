# MyGrTimeline
This is an Historic Add-In for the genealogy software Webtrees. 
It is a work in progress and gets updated occasionally. 
The focus of the timeline is focust on Western Macedonia in Greece, Pontos and Kars.

This is version number 0.1. The timeline will be updated without changing the version number because changes are made too frequently.
To use, upload the entire folder to webtrees/modules-v4.
The timeline also needs to be enabled on YOUR Webtrees website by going to Control Panel --> Modules --> Historic Events and checking "MyGrTimeline."
